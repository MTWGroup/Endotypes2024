This repository included sample codes associated with the Cluster analysis of blood biomarkers to identify molecular patterns in pulmonary fibrosis: assessment of a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort with independent validation

### Script one
Sample of the code used for biomarker imputation chains (start with CYFRA211)

### Script two
Sample of consensus clustering of the main model

### Script three
Sample of classification of Cluster 1 external dataset

### Script four
Random walk for model B minimal cluster

All the other scripts were adapted from the trajectory ppFVC analysis repository

These scripts were executed and designed using R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt) "Eye Holes". Functions and arguments used in R 4.3.2 
might be deprecated or behave differently in newer versions. Review the R changelog and package news for deprecated functions or changed behaviours.
